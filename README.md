# SIIT 2023 Blockchain Development Collection

This repository contains a collection of projects and resources developed for the SIIT 2023 Blockchain Development class. It includes smart contract backends, decentralized application (dApp) frontends, and comprehensive documentation on blockchain case studies and best practices.

---

## Overview

The projects in this repository were developed as part of the capstone assignment for the Blockchain Development class. The focus is on designing and implementing secure, efficient, and reliable smart contracts using Solidity, alongside building user-friendly decentralized applications. Key components include:

- **Smart Contract Backend:** Core smart contract logic for decentralized operations, following secure coding and gas optimization practices.
- **Decentralized Application Frontend:** A user interface designed to interact seamlessly with the smart contracts.
- **Documentation & Best Practices:** Detailed technical reports and guidelines, including case studies and industry applications, that illustrate practical blockchain solutions.
